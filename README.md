NSEW Virtual Keyboard
=====================

NSEW is a virtual keyboard layout aimed towards text insertion via
remote control directional keys (up, right, down, left and enter)
or a numpad. The normal keyboard layout (a retangular box) is clumsy
when used with this kind of device or in these specific conditions.

NSEW tries to solve this situation minimizing the number of strokes
needed to select a specific character, in accordance with the common
letter frequency of the English language (for now, other languages
will be added soon).

No, NSEW is not a Dvorak keyboard, or some adaptation of a standard
keyboard, it's an entirely new approach. The basic layout is the one
below.


         r
         i  cls
    spc  e  bks

    x y     u p
  c h o  §  t n d
    j g     m b

       f a w
       k s v
       z l q


The user presses the directional keys until the desired character is
under the cursor, then presses ENTER (or 5, in this demonstration). The
chosen character is inserted in the field area and the cursor gets
back to the central position (the § character).
